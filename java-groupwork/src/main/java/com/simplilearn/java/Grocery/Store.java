// 0. Make sure your project is in github and public. DONE
//1. Create a class with a meaningful name. DONE
//2. Create a main method DONE
//3. In main, create a new object of the type declared by your class. We will not be using static methods. DONE
//4. Decide the name of the operation you will be doing. 
//5. Decide input (names and types). Names must be meaningful and declare intention. DONE
//6. Decide output type. 
//7. Make the method that you are calling in main() to be public and add your curly braces.
//8. Create your tests in main
//9. Solve in your method that you have created. Be creative! If you
//decide to make other methods to call from your method, make these private.
