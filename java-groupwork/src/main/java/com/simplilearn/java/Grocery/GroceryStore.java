	============================================

	Homework with your team due next Saturday:
	Finish your sandwich checker!
	Model a Grocery Store:
	At least one, one-to-one relationship
	At least three one-to-many relationships
	At least one one-to-self relationships
	If you can, a many-to-many
	Code this in Java in the ways we demonstrated today.  No logic necessary but it must compile.
	Finally, be creative and go nuts!
	The Eclipse-Hello project where I left modeling examples: https://github.com/billatsimplilearn/eclipseHello  Remember, I work in this, but you need to work in the new java-groupwork project!
	Have a great week!  I look forward to seeing you all again next week (and hopefully my camera will work).
	
	*Don't get too specific. Example: how employee stock the products.
	*Customers buying things in the store.
